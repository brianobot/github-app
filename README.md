# Test Github Application

This app is a test app written to play around the documented github api for building programs/application that can interact with github as a user or as an application.

> You can use GitHub's API to build scripts and applications that automate processes, integrate with GitHub, and extend GitHub. For example, you could use the API to triage issues, build an analytics dashboard, or manage releases.
